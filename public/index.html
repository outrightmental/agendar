  <p><img src="/images/AgendarUsage1.jpg" alt="Agendar™ by Outright Mental™ is a Heads-Up Display for being on time">
  <p>In a world of remote meetings, challenges arise between the focus of working without distraction, and showing up on
    time for events.</p>
  <p>It may be especially challenging for a person using a computer to shift gears from deep focus without being a
    second late.</p>
  <p>Assume that I already use <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Calendar</a>
    to keep track of the events I will be attending. In order to optimize my chance of success, to cut through the
    tunnel vision and remain aware of events throughout the day, I mount a tablet on an arm on my desk, dedicated to
    displaying my agenda:</p>
  <p><img src="/images/BeforeAgendar.jpg" alt="Regular display of Google Calendar events"></p>
  <p>I tried this, and there was still something lacking. I want the absolute minimum amount of information, tightly
    centered around these principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full-screen app has a dark backdrop.</li>
    <li>Events are displayed in monochrome type with minimal decoration.</li>
    <li>Display a local time zone 24-hour clock with seconds.</li>
    <li>Show events from all calendars approaching within the next 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Display event time in terms of how far its beginning occurs from now.</li>
    <li>Within 1 hour of occurring, an event is highlighted in lighter gray.</li>
    <li>Within 10 minutes of occurring, an event is highlighted in yellow, to draw visual attention.</li>
    <li>Within 1 minute of occurring, an event is highlighted with an animated rainbow of all hues, to demand
      attention.
    </li>
    <li>Once it begins, an event is highlighted green as visual confirmation of attendance.</li>
    <li>Consistent progression of visual cues conditions for enhanced punctuality.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most crucially, there is a security requirement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Don't share my Google data!</em> Use the latest Google APIs to authenticate directly from a web
      browser, and display events, without touching my data.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>That's exactly what Agendar™ is!</p>
  <p>It's required to have <a href="https://calendar.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Calendar</a> in order to run the
    app in your web browser, authenticate directly with the latest Google APIs, and display events, without touching
    your data:</p>
  <p>Within 1 hour of occurring, an event is highlighted in lighter gray, and then within 10 minutes of occurring, an
    event is highlighted in yellow, to draw visual attention:</p>
  <p><img src="/images/AgendarUsage0.jpg" alt="Agendar™ by Outright Mental™ is a Heads-Up Display for being on time">
  </p>
  <p>Finally, as shown in the main photo, within 1 minute of occurring, an event is highlighted with an animated rainbow of all hues, to demand
    attention.</p>
